This is a demo yocto repository for reproducing an issue with bats tests
spending a lot of time in wait4() system call.

Building:

  git clone https://github.com/brgl/slow-bats-demo
  cd slow-bats-demo
  git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
  TEMPLATECONF=meta-slow-bats/conf/templates/slow-bats . ./layers/oe-init-build-env
  bitbake core-image-minimal

Running the VM:

  runqemu kvm slirp nographic
  # then login as 'root' with no password

Running tests inside the VM:

  # This will run all libgpiod tests. You can observe that the C and C++ tests
  # execute very fast, while bats tests take ~30 seconds to complete.
  ptest-runner libgpiod

Running bats tests individually:

  /usr/lib/libgpiod/ptest/tests/gpio-tools-test
